App design concept for Routie, an iOS outdoor route planning app â€” **[Download design concept](./routie-concept.png)**

I created the design concept in 2020 to start work on my next app.

## Motivation

As a trail runner and hiker, I was searching for the perfect mobile route planner. At the time, there were many web-based planners but not many powerful ones on mobile. I wanted to fill the gap.

**Limitations of existing apps**:
- Complex UI/UX
- Limited route editing features
- No way to insert waypoints anywhere on the route
- No drag and drop of waypoints to adapt the route on the fly
- No elevation chart (some apps)
- Limited route import/export capabilities for use in GPS devices and wearables

**Routie goals**:
- Powerful but intuitive waypoint editing capabilities
- Ease of use
- Lightning-fast to create routes with just a few taps

## Project Status

- [x] Design Concept
- [x] Prototype app

I started the project with a design concept highlighting the main use cases. This gave me a good feeling about the flow of the app. Then I tried to get a rough prototype out as quickly as possible to validate the idea with real users. 

I distributed the prototype via TestFlight for a while, extending it bit by bit based on feedback. Due to my main job, I didn't have sufficient time anymore to push the project further ðŸ¥²
